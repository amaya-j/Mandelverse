# Mandelverse

This repository contains a C++ program to generate the Mandelbrot set. The program uses a custom `Complex` class to handle complex number arithmetic and generates an image of the Mandelbrot set, saved as a PPM file.

## Overview

The Mandelbrot set is a famous fractal that is defined by iterating a simple mathematical function. Points in the complex plane are tested to see if they belong to the set by iterating the function and checking if the magnitude of the result remains bounded.

## Features

- Uses a custom `Complex` class for complex number operations.
- Generates a PPM image of the Mandelbrot set.
- Configurable image dimensions.


### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Standard C++ libraries
